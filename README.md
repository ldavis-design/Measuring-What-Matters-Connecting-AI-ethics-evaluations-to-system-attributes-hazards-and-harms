# Dataset Information and Interactive Visualization Link

Currently, this work is on Version 1.0 of the publicly shared dataset and corresponding visualization. The dataset is in a Microsoft Excel (.xslx) format. Note that it is not recommended to open the file in a .csv format due to the increased likelihood of corrupted characters and file formatting. Please read the below sections for more information on the dataset.

## Using the Dataset
The spreadsheet includes user guidance stages grouping fifteen columns. These user guidance stages intentionally divide and describe the data columns among similarities that they share. The interactive Sunburst visualization can be found here: **https://rai-measures-dataset.onrender.com**. 

**Target Output (Columns A and B)**: The resulting measures collected in this dataset.
  1. Measure
  2. Measurement Process
     
**Entry Points (Columns C and D)**: The primary features in narrowing down potential measures for an algorithmic system.

  4. Principle
  5. Component of the ML System

**Connections to Harm (Columns E - H)**: Investigating the identification and relations to harm, hazards, and attributes.
  6. Primary Harm
  7. Secondary Harm
  8. Hazard
  9. Attribute

**Measurement Properties (Columns I - K)**: The standard(s) per which each measure uses in its evaluation.

  10. Criterion Name 
  11. Criterion Description 
  12. Type of Assessment

**Algorithmic System Characteristics (Columns L - O)**: Additional features that a user can consider when narrowing down measures to use.

  13. Application Area
  14. Purpose of ML System 
  15. Type of Data
  16. Algorithm Type

**Publication Metadata (Columns P - R)**: Details further documentation into each source that was extracted to collect each feature and measure.

  17. Title (Note its hyperlink to the article itself)
  18. Year
  19. Key Contributions 

## Using the Interactive Visualization
